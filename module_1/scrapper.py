'''
The code follows similarly to the code in part 1, it takes in a list of the URLs
and scrapes the data from each one using requests for HTTPS requests and bs4 for extracting data.

The time.sleep() function is there as a precautionary measure to not make requests in very short periods
after it iterates through the websites, it returns the data.

This follows Single Responsibility Principle due to this class having a single responsibility 
which is to scrape data from the sites given. This can be modified without changing other files
