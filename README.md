# Project 4: Implemenation of Test Cases
## Ian Wall / Aaron Nobbe
The objective of this project was to test for issues in the code, and write handlers to print out what goes wrong. 

## List of Test Cases Created
- Import packages
- Importing Modules
- Reading Files to correct location
- Writing Files to correct location
- Invalid API
- Invalid Articles
- Check if directories are correctly made and allocated
- Check if our files are correctly made and allocated

Locations of these test cases are located on the open issues section. These include the file and the lines these test cases were made.

Closed issues have each test case and also where the test cases were written to.
